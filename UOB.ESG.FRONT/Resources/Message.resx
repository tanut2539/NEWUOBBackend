    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Our sustainability governance structure provides oversight and accountability on the implementation of our responsible investment policy. Our UOBAM Board of directors through the Management Committee (MC), reviews long-term business and organisational goals and provides the strategic direction for UOBAM’s sustainable investments and sustainability practices. The MC manages the implementation of strategic direction that is handed down by UOBAM’s Board of Directors and will be supported by our Regional Sustainability Group (RSG), Local Sustainability Group (LSG), and dedicated Sustainability Offices (SO).
The RSG reports directly to the MC on sustainable investing matters and is made up of the Sustainability Chairs and Champions from each regional office. The RSG coordinates with MC to guide the regional implementation of our sustainable investment mandates as well as sustainability initiatives.
The LSG at each office is supported by dedicated Country SO to monitor and report on the progress of our sustainability activities and mandates. The Country Sustainability Champions take the lead in our corporate sustainability activities, which include ESG product and solution launches, thought leadership and events, sustainability staff training, and corporate sustainability stewardship programmes, and Dedicated ESG Investment Specialists leading their respective offices in implementing our sustainable investing framework.
UOBAM’s dedicated regional SO incorporated into the overall investment organization structure supports our sustainability governance structure with the integration of our ESG investment methodology and implementation of strategic sustainability initiatives. The SOs, each comprising the country’s ESG Champion, a dedicated ESG Investment Specialist and Investment Team. These teams possess local expertise and on-ground engagement through the utilization of dedicated ESG resources to execute engagement for companies in the portfolio in the event of a controversy or to determine specific ESG information. Dedicated ESG resources also provide manual ESG scoring coverage on companies that are not covered by major third-party ESG data providers.
The Singapore Sustainability Office and Centre of Excellence (SOCE) works in close collaboration with all UOBAM regional SOs in order to ensure that companies managed in the portfolio are well positioned for secular growth and alpha generation. The SOCE utilises UOBAM’s integrated ESG management system to facilitate two-way data transfer and to obtain ESG coverage from regional offices, whilst simultaneously delivering real-time updates on the ESG performance of companies, as well as news alerts, to ensure that controversies detected can be followed up with engagement action. The SOCE also develops the governance controls and systems in place to ensure the implementation of UOBAM’s Sustainable Investment policy and corporate and communications plans.</value>

    <value>We take an inside-out approach to sustainable investing and move beyond just focusing on internal processes such as ESG integration into investment processes and sustainable investment governance. We look to take a proactive approach towards driving sustainable investing externally which ties in closely with the principle of “working together in implementing the principles” where our external efforts include establishing strategic investment partnerships with global sustainability leaders such as Robeco and Fukoku Capital Management.
Through such external partnerships that we aim to further enhance our capabilities and develop the accessibility of sustainability investment opportunities in the Asia region for investors. This will be done through sustainability mandates, working in policy consultation, and responsible investment education and thought leadership.</value>

    <value>We believe that Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues are financially material to a company’s performance and will translate to material financial impact on the investments that we make. As part of our fiduciary duty to our investors, we have put in place our sustainable investing framework and process which focuses on deep fundamental research, augmented by the use of technology and leveraging on our local expertise. &lt;br&gt; Our proprietary sustainable investment framework is a common framework that is utilised across the firm, and is implemented through the integration of ESG evaluation within our investment process. The process of ESG evaluation involves the assessment of material ESG factors of companies which is determined by UOBAM’s proprietary materiality map.
UOBAM’s proprietary materiality map is developed by referencing the Sustainability Accounting and Standards Board (SASB) materiality map. UOBAM’s proprietary materiality map also assigns specific E, S and G pillar weights to companies across 11 sectors that are classified using Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). Below is an overview of how ESG is incorporated into our investment process.</value>

  <data name="appoach_detail5" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>To complement ESG incorporation into our investment process, we also have in place an Active Ownership Policy which has a coverage that aligns to the Sustainable Investment Policy. The Active Ownership Policy serves to facilitate dialogue, engagement, and proxy voting. We will leverage our regional footprint and the local expertise of our regional investment teams to execute meaningful dialogues and engagement which will drive strategic investment decisions for the sustainable investments we make.
To quantify and enable our investors to better understand how their investments are helping to address critical global issues such as climate change and human capital management, we have developed internal capabilities to carry out portfolio impact analysis to highlight how we reduce our environmental footprint, and to make a more tangible contribution to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), UOBAM will also integrate impact measurement aligned with these global trends as part of portfolio analysis.
We also continuously monitor on a global and regional basis, the changing regulatory landscape that impacts sustainable investing. Whenever possible, we will participate in responding to regulatory consultations to provide our inputs and help guide and develop ESG policies and guidelines that support the advancement of the six Principles of the PRI. Our responses to such regulatory consultations will be aligned to our sustainable investing policy and will look to support the six Principles of the PRI. To ensure that this alignment is achieved, we have in place our sustainability governance structure that will provide oversight and accountability for our responses.</value>

Throughout the engagement process, we gain valuable insights into our investee companies’ propensity deal with ESG issues and whether they will take the appropriate measures to manage these issues. Engagement acts as an important information source to aid our investment decision.
By engaging with companies, we can also encourage improvement in their ESG disclosure, identify the need to advocate positive change, communicate our concerns and improve its practices on ESG issues, where necessary.
We prioritise our engagement based on geography of companies and size of holdings, severity of identified material ESG issue, potential to generate long-term value following a successful engagement, and specific client request(s).

Ultimately, if the company still continuously fails to meet the standards expected after the engagement timeline, UOBAM will decide to reduce our exposure to investment holdings size or divest our investment in the company.</value>

  <data name="section_2_ceo_history" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In recent years, the importance of sustainability has been rapidly increasing. At UOBAM, we recognise that we have an important role to play as socially responsible stewards to drive sustainability in the world.
 
The investment community has a key role to play in supporting sustainability and the growing emphasis on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues by channelling capital into sustainable opportunities, while supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).
 
Asset owners and investors have become increasingly committed to ensure that they are investing responsibly and for a greater purpose. Thus, as Asset Managers, we have a responsibility to be socially responsible stewards for the world to look up to and we can play a vital role by offering sustainable investing solutions for both asset owners and investors alike.
 
We believe integrating ESG evaluation into our investment process across all investment asset classes will contribute to performance by enabling us to identify high-quality companies which are resilient, well-managed, able to grow sustainably and are likely to maintain their competitiveness in the long term.
 
By doing so, we can accommodate our clients’ needs to invest for profit and purpose, as we manage their wealth successfully, responsibly, and sustainably. Here at UOBAM, we understand that sustainability is a continuous journey and to have a more tangible contribution to the UN SDGs, we will embed sustainability as a core component of our corporate culture. This will allow us to be active stewards of sustainability, achieve long-term value creation and positive impact to the environment, our communities, and stakeholders.
 
Ultimately, at UOBAM, we invest for profit and purpose whilst shaping a better world for future generations.</value>

  <data name="section_2_ceo_history1" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the past few years, the concept of sustainable corporate development or ESG which stands for Environment, Social and Governance are based on the fact that business operations interact with environment and human social life which has grown in popularity. Hence, to balance how the businesses co-exist with the environment and society, companies could enhance and sustaining their profitability. This includes incorporating the ESG concept in investments to which the investors have been increasingly pay attention. Since UOBAM recognized, with its own vision, the importance of managing the investments within the framework of social responsibility 18 years ago, it has pioneered its investment practice based on the companies’ good corporate governance. 
 
This is our commitment to be a leadership in the ESG concept in investment dimensions. UOBAM group and UOBAM (Thailand) has signed the Principles for Responsible Investment with the United Nation Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI) in January 2020 publicly demonstrate its commitment to responsible investment and build networks with the parties in the global capital market in advocating collaboration to develop Thailand’s capital market sustainably under the framework of ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance). In September 2021, UOBAM also participated the signing ceremony the statement of commitment for “Sustainable Thailand 2021” which is the collaboration of over 40 organizations among the government, institutional investors, and banks to reinforce Thailand’s financial system in playing a sustainable role in the country development.
 
We believes integrating ESG factors enhances its research and investment methodology, consequently assisting in generating better long-term returns for its investors. In addition, as more Thai and global businesses from a variety of industries assimilate ESG factors into their business processes and aim for long-term sustainable growth, at UOBAM (Thailand) we invest for profit and purpose, towards a sustainable future.</value>
